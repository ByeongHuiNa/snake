snake
=====

Simple snake game written in C using ncurses.

You can run it using

```
make run
```

This was the biggest C program I'd written so far, so I'm pretty happy with it. There's a separate frontend and backend so theoretically it could be easily extended to have a graphical frontend instead of a ncurses frontend, but I'm unlikely to actually do that.
